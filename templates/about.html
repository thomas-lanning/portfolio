                        Welcome to my portfolio! While my homepage already highlights my CV and professional background,
                        I’d like to use this section to share a bit more about myself beyond work.
                    </p>

                        Sports have always been a big part of my life. Recently, I’ve been enjoying running, but I also love playing
                        football, tennis, and swimming. Staying active keeps me energized and helps me maintain focus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also have an insatiable curiosity for learning new things. This drive is what led me to build and host
                        this website from scratch, teaching myself web development along the way. It's also why I first learned to code—
                        entirely self-taught—and why I find myself diving into the most unexpected topics. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of the more unusual subjects I’ve explored include RF analysis, PCB design, car mechanics, and even
                        how insurance-linked securities work. Whenever I find something interesting, I enjoy delving deep and
                        understanding it as thoroughly as possible. It's this mindset that keeps life exciting and continuously
                        fuels my personal and professional growth.
